# Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) – Week 2

## Overview
This repository contains the documentation and artifacts for the **Week 2 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** task. The objective of this task was to understand and apply VAPT concepts by performing scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting in a controlled lab environment.

The assessment was conducted using intentionally vulnerable systems to safely demonstrate real-world security testing techniques.
